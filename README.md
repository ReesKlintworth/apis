# apis
Various API endpoints hosted at api.reesklintworth.com

This repository houses the API endpoints I've built out for different applications and side projects I'm working on. Currently, these are all deployed to a single AWS EC2 instance via Docker, which allows me to have multiple services running, including a single container dedicated to providing a mongo database for the APIs that need it.
